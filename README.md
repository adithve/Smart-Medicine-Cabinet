The Smart Tablet Cabinet (STC) is a low-cost, automated pill dispenser designed to help individuals—especially the elderly and chronically ill—manage their medication schedules accurately and independently. The system aims to reduce missed doses and increase adherence to treatment plans by automatically dispensing pills at preset times.Built around an Arduino Uno, the system uses a Real-Time Clock (RTC) module to track time, a stepper motor to rotate and release pills, an LCD display to show the time and status, and a buzzer to alert the user when it’s time to take medicine. Pills are stored in a modified cylindrical tube, and the rotation mechanism ensures that only one pill is dispensed at a time.The prototype was successfully tested and is simple, compact, and user-friendly. It can improve medication compliance, especially for users without constant caregiver supervision.
